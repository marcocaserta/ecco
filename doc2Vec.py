 Algorithm for the Computation of Distances between documents.

 Author: Marco Caserta (marco dot caserta at ie dot edu)
 Started : 02.02.2018
 Updated : 27.02.2018 -> introduction of a cycle
           09.03.2018 -> shortlist creation using Doc2Vec (per year)
 Ended   :

 Command line options (see parseCommandLine):
 -s name of file containing the target sentence, i.e., the query

NOTE: This code is based on the tutorial from:

https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/docs/notebooks/doc2vec-lee.ipynb

Branch ECCO:

The idea is to work on the documents of the ECCO dataset at a sentence level.
Given a "reference sentence," we want to find the list of sentences closer to
the target in a given pool of sentences. Note that the dataset must be
organized at a sentence level.

As of today, this can be achieved in a number of ways. We explore:
- doc2vec, which provides an embeddding for each document
- wmd, which transforms a sentence into another solving a transportation pbr

We observed that the doc2vec query is pretty fast, with the advantage that the
actual doc2vec model can be precomputed. Once the doc2vec model is available,
computing the distance between a query sentence and any of the documents in the
corpus is quite fast. In contrast, wmd is computationally intensive. Therefore,
the idea is to use both of them in sequence:
1. use doc2vec on the premium set of sentences for a given time period retrieve
the N most similar sentences (N can be quite large here). Let us call this list
the "shortlist".
2. use the N sentences retrieved in the previous step (i.e., the shortlist) as
input to the wmd algorithm. Since N << number of premium sentences << original
number of sentences (i.e., before applying the premium list filter), wmd is
able to provide an answer in an amount of time which depends on N.

Why not just using doc2vec? It seems the similarity measure produced by wmd
outperforms the one given by doc2vec. In addition, it allows to use any
embedding (not just the one provided by word2vec) to assign a numerical vector
to each word of the document.

The high-level structure of the algorithm is thus as follows:
for each year in the period:
    read premium lists for that year and the corresponding doc2vec model
    get the N/(nr.years) best sentences w.r.t. the query sentence
    store the shortlist into the docs and corpus structure
At this point, docs and corpus contain the shortlists built over all the years
of the period under analysis. Pass docs to wmd and get the top list (i.e., the
very limited, human readable, set of sentences that are the closest to the
query.)
